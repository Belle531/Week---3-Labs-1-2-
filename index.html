    <p class="paragraph-1"><em>CSS Selector:</em> The preferred method for styling <strong>HTML</strong> elements is using CSS classes. A CSS class Selector, such as <strong>.paragraph-1</strong>, identifies <strong>HTML</strong> elements that have been assigned the class paragraph-1.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-2">The dot (.) signifies that it's a class selector. Within the CSS rule, properties like <em>color</em> are used to define the element's appearance. In this example, <em>color</em> is the property, and <em>blue</em> is the value assigned to it, determining the text color.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-3">Separating <strong>CSS</strong> from <strong>HTML</strong>, ideally into its own file, offers several key advantages. It greatly improves maintainability, as changes to the style of all elements with a specific class can be made in a single locationâ€”the <strong>CSS</strong> file.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-4">This approach also promotes reusability, allowing the same <strong>CSS</strong> class to be applied to multiple <strong>HTML</strong> elements. Finally, organizing <strong>CSS</strong> separately from <strong>HTML</strong> makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and simpler to understand, contributing to a more efficient development workflow.</p>
