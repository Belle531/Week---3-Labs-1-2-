             <h2>Study Session Tips & Tricks:</h2>
             <h3>It's Rubber Duck Time</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation is Key:</strong> Please come prepared with your class materials,
                computer ready,and any questions you have writeen down beforehand.
                This will help us maximize out time together and ensure everyone 
                gets their questions answered</li>
                <li><strong>Respect Communication:</strong> To avoid interrupting someone's train of thought, 
                please raise your hand virtually or send a message depending on the platform we use before speaking. 
                Let's be mindful of others and allow everyone a chance to get the help they need.</li>
                <li><strong>Mute When Not Speakeing:</strong> Please keep your microphone muted unless you are actively speaking. 
                This will help minimize background noise and distractions, allowing everyone to focus.</li>
                <li><strong>Teamwork Makes the Dream Work:</strong> Remember,we are teammates on theis jorurney!
